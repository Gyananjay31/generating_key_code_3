🧠 Keyboard Code Generator
This is a simple JavaScript project that listens for keyboard events and displays the key you pressed along with its corresponding key, keyCode, and code values on the screen. It's an educational tool to help developers understand how keyboard events work in the browser using basic DOM and EventListener concepts.

🚀 Features
Real-time detection of any key press on the keyboard.

Displays:

key – The actual character of the key pressed.

keyCode – The numeric code for the key (deprecated but still widely seen).

code – The physical key on the keyboard.

📸 Preview
When you press any key, you'll instantly see something like:
You Pressed: A
key: "a"
keyCode: 65
code: "KeyA"

🛠️ Tech Used

CSS

JavaScript (DOM + EventListener)
